/**
* I know these descriptions don't make sense, but the functions I use act a bit different depending on situation.
a) FbxAnimStack::GetLocalTimeSpan will return you the start and stop time for this stack (or take). It's simply two time values that can be set to anything regardless of animation curves. Generally speaking, applications set these to the start and stop time of the timeline.
b) As for FbxNode::GetAnimationInternval, this one will iterate through all properties recursively, and then for all animation curves it finds, for the animation layer index specified. So in other words, if one property has been animated, it will modify this result. This is completely different from GetLocalTimeSpan since it calculates the time span depending on the keys rather than just using the start and stop time that was saved in the file.
